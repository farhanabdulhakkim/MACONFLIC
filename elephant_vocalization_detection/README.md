# 🐘 Elephant Vocalization Detection Using AI & ML Techniques

## 1. Project Overview & Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
*"To develop an AI-based system for detecting elephant vocalizations from acoustic recordings and analysing their acoustic characteristics."*

**The Goal:**  
Build a **Working AI Baseline Model** that can accurately classify **Elephant Vocalization Types** (Rumble, Roar, Trumpet) and distinguish them from **Non-Elephant Background Noise** — a 4-class classification problem.

**Why this approach?**  
This project strictly focuses on *acoustic signal detection* and *characteristic analysis*. It does not attempt to perform multimodal semantic-analysis or claim to "translate" elephant language. By keeping the initial system purely software-focused, we ensure a highly accurate, scientifically defensible core engine that can be extended later to IoT hardware and real-time field deployment.

**Source Dataset:** 
The audio data originates from the **"Elephant Sound Classification Using Raw Audio"** research project (Dewmini et al., *Sensors MDPI, 2025* — [ DOI: 10.3390/s25020352](https://doi.org/10.3390/s25020352)). The original dataset provides curated, pre-labeled 6-second `.wav` clips organised into three elephant caller types (Rumble, Roar, Trumpet) with train/validate/test splits.

## 2. What Has Been Accomplished — Step by Step
Below is a clear, chronological walkthrough of every step completed so far, what each script does, and what it produces.

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Download (`download_data.py`)

**What it does:**  
Automatically downloads the raw elephant audio recordings from the **Dryad African Elephant Acoustic Dataset** — a public repository hosted at `datadryad.org`.

**How it works:**
1. Downloads three zip files from Dryad:
   - `clips.zip` — Short segmented audio clips
   - `labels.zip` — Annotation/label files
   - `audio.zip` — Full-length audio streams
2. Extracts each zip into a corresponding folder inside `data/`.
3. Skips downloads that already exist (resume-safe).
4. Shows a **progress bar** (via `tqdm`) for each download.

**What it produces:**
```
data/
├── clips/       ← extracted audio clips
├── labels/      ← annotation files
└── audio/       ← full audio streams
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.download_data
```

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Negative Class Generation (`generate_negatives.py`)

**Why this is needed:**  
The original dataset only contains elephant sounds (Rumble, Roar, Trumpet). For the AI to learn what is **NOT** an elephant, we need a "Non-Elephant" class with realistic background noise.

**What it does:**  
Generates synthetic 6-second `.wav` files containing environmental noise — no elephant sounds at all. Each file uses one of three noise profiles, randomly selected:

| Noise Type | How It's Generated | What It Simulates |
|---|---|---|
| **White Noise** | `np.random.normal(0, 1, N)` | Uniform random signal (radio static) |
| **Brown Noise** | Cumulative sum of white noise | Low-frequency rumble (wind, thunder) |
| **Pink Noise** | Moving average of white noise | Ambient environment (rain, rustling) |

**Key parameters:**
- Duration: **6.0 seconds** (matches elephant clips exactly)
- Sample rate: **44,100 Hz**
- Random gain applied: **0.1 – 0.5** (so clips aren't all at the same volume)

**How many samples are generated:**
| Split | Count |
|---|---|
| Train | 77 |
| Validate | 18 |
| Test | 9 |

These counts roughly match the average number of samples in each elephant class, so the dataset starts balanced.

**What it produces:**
```
data/Audio-Classification-for-Elephant-Sounds/data/
├── train/Non_Elephant/      ← 77 synthetic .wav files
├── validate/Non_Elephant/   ← 18 synthetic .wav files
└── test/Non_Elephant/       ← 9 synthetic .wav files
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.generate_negatives
```

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Dataset Profiling & Indexing (`prepare_dataset.py`)

**What it does:**  
Scans every `.wav` file across all splits (train/validate/test) and all classes (Roar, Rumble, Trumpet, Non_Elephant), reads their metadata using `librosa`, and builds a master CSV index.

**For each audio file, it extracts:**
- Absolute file path
- Split (train / validate / test)
- Class label (Roar / Rumble / Trumpet / Non_Elephant)
- Duration (in seconds)
- Sampling rate (in Hz)
- Whether the file is corrupted (True/False)

**It also prints a full statistical report:**
- Total number of audio files
- Class distribution (how many files per class)
- Split distribution (how many files per split)
- Duration statistics per class (min / max / average)
- All unique sampling rates found

**What it produces:**
```
data/dataset_index.csv    ← Master index of ALL original audio files with metadata
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.prepare_dataset
```

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Dataset Scaling via Audio Augmentation (`augment_dataset.py`)

**Why this is needed:**  
The original dataset has only ~100 recordings per class. This is far too small for a CNN to generalise effectively — it would simply memorise the training data (overfit). We need thousands of samples per class.

**What it does — full pipeline (4 stages):**

#### Stage 1: Pool All Originals
Collects every `.wav` file from all three splits (train/validate/test) and all four classes into a single pool. This ensures no bias from the original split.

#### Stage 2: Clean Re-Split (70 / 15 / 15)
Re-distributes all original files into new train/validate/test splits using a **70/15/15 ratio**. This is critical: **no original file's augmented copies can appear in more than one split** (prevents data leakage).

#### Stage 3: Augment to Target Count
For each split and each class, copies the original files, then generates augmented variants until the target count is reached:

| Split | Target per Class | Total (4 classes) |
|---|---|---|
| **Train** | 500 | 2,000 |
| **Validate** | 500 | 2,000 |
| **Test** | 100 | 400 |
| | | **Grand Total: 4,400** |

Each augmented sample applies **1–2 random techniques** from the following table:

| Technique | Function | What It Simulates | Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Time Shifting** | `np.roll(y, shift)` | Vocalization not starting at clip onset | ±30% shift |
| **Pitch Shifting** | `librosa.effects.pitch_shift()` | Natural variation between individual elephants | ±2 semitones |
| **Time Stretching** | `librosa.effects.time_stretch()` | Variation in call duration | 0.85× – 1.15× speed |
| **Additive Noise** | White/Brown/Pink noise injection | Varying environmental conditions (wind, rain) | 0.002 – 0.015 level |
| **Gain Variation** | `y × 10^(dB/20)` | Different recording distances / mic sensitivity | ±6 dB |

**File naming convention:**  
Every augmented file is traceable back to its source:
```
{OriginalFileName}_aug{0001}_{pitchshift+addnoise}.wav
```

#### Stage 4: Save Dataset Index
Writes a comprehensive CSV with one row per file:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `filepath` | Absolute path to the .wav file |
| `split` | train / validate / test |
| `label` | Roar / Rumble / Trumpet / Non_Elephant |
| `duration_sec` | Always 6.0 seconds |
| `sampling_rate` | 16,000 Hz (standardised) |
| `source` | "original" or "augmented" |
| `augmentation` | "none" or technique name(s) used |
| `original_file` | Basename of the source recording |

**What it produces:**
```
data/scaled_dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── Roar/           ← 500 .wav files
│   ├── Rumble/         ← 500 .wav files

data/scaled_dataset_index.csv   ← Master index of all 4,400 augmented files
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.augment_dataset
```

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Feature Extraction & PyTorch Data Loading (`features.py`)

**What it does:**  
Converts raw audio waveforms into numerical representations (features) that a neural network can understand.

**The core feature: Mel-Spectrogram**

A Mel-Spectrogram is a 2D image representation of audio:
- **X-axis** = Time (seconds)
- **Y-axis** = Frequency (Hz), spaced on the Mel scale (mimics human hearing)
- **Color intensity** = Amplitude/Loudness (in decibels)

**Processing pipeline for each audio file:**
1. Load audio at **16,000 Hz** sample rate (resampled if different)
2. Pad or trim to exactly **6.0 seconds** (96,000 samples)
3. Compute **128-band Mel-spectrogram** (fmax = 8,000 Hz)
4. Convert power to decibels (`librosa.power_to_db`)
5. Wrap in a PyTorch `FloatTensor` with shape `(1, 128, time_steps)` — the `1` is the channel dimension (grayscale)

**Alternative feature:** Also supports **MFCC** (40-coefficient Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) extraction, selectable via `feature_type='mfcc'`.

**4-Class Label Mapping:**
| Class | Label Index |
|---|---|
| Roar | 0 |
| Rumble | 1 |
| Trumpet | 2 |
| Non_Elephant | 3 |

**Additional utility:** `generate_sample_plots()` creates a side-by-side visual comparing a Rumble sample and a Non_Elephant sample — both as waveform and Mel-spectrogram — saved as `data/sample_features.png`.

**Command to generate sample plots:**
```bash
python -m src.features
```

---

### ✅ Step 6 — CNN Model Architecture (`model.py`)

**What it is:**  
A lightweight **3-block Convolutional Neural Network** called `ElephantIntentCNN` designed to classify Mel-spectrogram images.

**Architecture diagram:**
```
Input: (Batch, 1, 128, TimeSteps)  ← Single-channel Mel-spectrogram
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Conv2D(1 → 16, 3×3, pad=1)    │
│  BatchNorm2D(16)                │
│  ReLU                           │
│  MaxPool2D(2×2)                 │  ← Detects simple patterns (edges, lines)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Conv2D(16 → 32, 3×3, pad=1)   │
│  BatchNorm2D(32)                │
│  ReLU                           │
│  MaxPool2D(2×2)                 │  ← Detects intermediate patterns (curves, textures)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Conv2D(32 → 64, 3×3, pad=1)   │
│  BatchNorm2D(64)                │
│  ReLU                           │
│  MaxPool2D(2×2)                 │  ← Detects complex patterns (frequency sweeps)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  AdaptiveAvgPool2D(4×4)         │  ← Forces output to fixed 4×4 regardless of input size
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Flatten → Dense(1024 → 128)    │
│  ReLU                           │
│  Dropout(0.5)                   │  ← Randomly drops 50% of neurons to prevent overfitting
│  Dense(128 → 4)                 │  ← Output: 4 class scores
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why these design choices:**
| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| `AdaptiveAvgPool2d(4,4)` | Handles variable-length audio — always produces the same size tensor for the dense layers |
| `BatchNorm` after every conv | Stabilises training by normalising layer outputs; allows higher learning rates |
| `Dropout(0.5)` | Prevents overfitting, especially important when training on augmented data |
| 3 conv blocks (16→32→64) | Progressively deeper feature hierarchy without being too heavy for the dataset size |

---

### ✅ Step 7 — Model Training (`train.py`)

**What it does:**  
Trains the CNN model on the scaled augmented dataset and saves the best weights.

**Training configuration:**
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `SimpleCNN` (same architecture as ElephantIntentCNN, 4-class output) |
| Optimizer | **Adam** (learning rate = 0.001) |
| Loss Function | **CrossEntropyLoss** (standard for multi-class classification) |
| Epochs | **15** |
| Batch Size | **32** |
| Device | Auto-selects **CUDA GPU** if available, otherwise **CPU** |
| Dataset | `scaled_dataset_index.csv` (4,400 samples) |

**What happens each epoch:**
1. **Training phase:** Feed all training batches through the model, compute loss, backpropagate, update weights.
2. **Validation phase:** Feed all validation batches through the model (no weight updates), compute loss and accuracy.
3. Print both train and val metrics for that epoch.

**What it produces:**
```
models/
├── baseline_cnn.pth        ← Saved model weights (the "learned brain")
└── training_curves.png     ← Plot of Loss and Accuracy per epoch (train vs val)
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.train
```

---

### ✅ Step 8 — Model Evaluation (`evaluate.py`)

**What it does:**  
Loads the trained model and evaluates it against the **held-out test set** (data the model has never seen during training).

**Metrics generated:**
| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | % of all test clips correctly classified |
| **Precision** (per class) | When the model predicted this class, how often was it right? |
| **Recall** (per class) | Out of all true samples of this class, how many did the model catch? |
| **F1-Score** (per class) | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall — balances both |
| **Confusion Matrix** | 4×4 grid showing exactly where the model gets confused |

**Baseline results (from the initial binary model on unscaled data):**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Non-Elephant | 0.53 | 1.00 | 0.69 | 9 |
| Elephant | 1.00 | 0.70 | 0.83 | 27 |
| **Overall Accuracy** | | | **0.78** | **36** |

> ⚠️ **Note:** These results are from the initial binary classifier on unscaled data (only 36 test samples). The 4-class model trained on the scaled augmented dataset (4,400 samples, 400 test) is expected to produce significantly better and more reliable results.

**What it produces:**
```
models/
├── confusion_matrix.png     ← Heatmap of predicted vs actual labels
└── evaluation_report.txt    ← Full classification report (text)
```

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m src.evaluate
```

---

### ✅ Step 9 — Interactive Demo App (`app.py`)

**What it is:**  
A **Streamlit web application** that lets anyone upload an audio file and get an instant AI prediction — no coding required.

**What you can do:**
1. **Upload** any `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.flac` audio file
2. **Listen** to the audio playback in the browser
3. Click **"Analyze"** to get:
   - 🏷️ **Prediction:** Elephant Vocalization or Non-Elephant
   - 📊 **Confidence Score:** How certain the model is (0–100%)
   - 📐 **Acoustic Characteristics:** Duration (seconds) and Dominant Frequency (Hz)
   - 🎨 **Mel-Spectrogram:** Visual "fingerprint" of the uploaded audio

**Command to run:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
